description: Research a feature — spawns research-agent to gather requirements and context
---

Spawn the **research-agent** for feature: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Normalize feature name** to kebab-case before proceeding.

## Steps
1. Create directory `.claude/features/$ARGUMENTS/` if it doesn't exist
2. Launch a research-agent: "Research feature '$ARGUMENTS'. Read CLAUDE.md and the spec at `.claude/docs/config-visualizer-spec.md` (plus anything else in `docs/` at project root). Write output to `.claude/features/$ARGUMENTS/`."
3. When agent returns, verify the research doc was created
4. Update `.claude/pipeline/STATUS.md`: feature=`$ARGUMENTS`, phase=`research-complete`, next=`/plan $ARGUMENTS`
5. Give user a 2-3 line summary of findings
6. Suggest: "Research done. Run `/plan $ARGUMENTS`?"

## Expected Output
The agent creates `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS_research.md` with: Goal, Requirements (FR/TR), Code Examples, Affected Code, Patterns to Follow, Risks, Open Questions, Recommended Approach, Scope estimate.

**Do NOT research it yourself. Spawn the agent.**

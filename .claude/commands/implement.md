description: Implement a feature — spawns execute-agent which delegates to frontend/backend agents
---

Spawn the **execute-agent** for feature: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Prerequisites
Verify `.claude/features/$ARGUMENTS/*_plan.md` exists. If not → "Run `/plan $ARGUMENTS` first."

## Steps
1. Launch an execute-agent: "Implement feature '$ARGUMENTS'. Read the latest plan doc and CLAUDE.md. Delegate viewer/ tasks to frontend-agent, crawler/ tasks to backend-agent. Follow TDD. Check off tasks as you complete them."
2. When agent returns, verify progress.md was created and tasks are checked off
3. Update `.claude/pipeline/STATUS.md`: phase=`implement-complete`, next=`/test $ARGUMENTS`
4. Give user a 2-3 line summary (what was built, test results, any blocked tasks)
5. Suggest: "Implementation done. Run `/test $ARGUMENTS`?"

## Expected Output
The agent checks off tasks in the plan doc and creates `.claude/active-work/$ARGUMENTS/progress.md` with: Changes table, Delegation log, Blocked tasks (if any), Final test/lint state.

**Do NOT implement it yourself. Spawn the agent.**
